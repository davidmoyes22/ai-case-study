# DataVisor Case Study

## Background

### History
DataVisor was founded by Fang Yu and Yinglian Xie on December 20, 2013. Both women collectively hold 24 patents, have published more than 50 research papers, and have PhDs in Computer Science.

Fang Yu and Yinglian Xie met while working at Microsoft Research where they worked together for 7 years building technological enhancements to help secure digital customer assets. The both share a passion for leveraging algorithms and big data to improve security for their customers and this is a major reason why they created DataVisor.

Over the course of the last 10 years, DataVisor has completed 6 rounds of funding totalling a disclosed amount of $94.5M. The table below shows a breakdown of the rounds of funding undergone by DataVisor as documented on [Crunchbase.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/datavisor/company_financials)

### Business Need
In a [press release](https://www.datavisor.com/news/datavisor-raises-14-5m-to-protect-consumer-facing-websites-and-mobile-apps-from-cyber-criminals/) announcing the completion of their Series A round of funding, Yinglian Xie, CEO and co-founder of DataVisor clearly stated the business opportunity and vision of DataVisor.

>The rapid expansion of online services and mobile apps has led to an explosion of user accounts, ushering in the ‚Äòbillion-user era,' ...Cyber thieves are using this growth to their advantage, using fake and compromised accounts to easily hide in the shadows and conduct various forms of fraud against websites and mobile apps. Our mission is to build and restore trust in online communities and services and to protect every one of us legitimate users by finding the hidden enemy lurking within them.

This press release goes on to state that, in 2015 alone, cyber fraud was expected to exceed $50B in loses from online users. As cyber criminals have adopted increasingly complex and effective in their methods of attack, existing security solutions have become inneffective at identifying or stopping them. This is where DataVisor comes in.

### The Solution
DataVisor's product offering is built on a patent-pending analytics engine that leverages Apache Spark (a big data analytics platform) to analyze billions of security events each hour. It is designed to identify fraudulent attacks early, without the need to manually label or train the data.

ü•á In the 2023, DataVisor was awarded Best Transaction Fraud Monitoring and Decisioning‚Äù solution in the Fraud & AML Impact Awards.ü•á

Datos Insights cited the following reasons for DataVisor being deserving of the award.

- "The ability to uncover hidden relationships between known fraud accounts and other accounts with DataVisor‚Äôs Unsupervised Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph technology
- Support for an extensive set of use cases, including new account creation, account takeover, online applications, and multiple forms of payments.
- Dynamic workflows based on risk levels of the member and account‚Äîrather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach to authentication and fraud mitigation."

### Target Market
 DataVisor protects medium to large businesses, globally, from account takeovers, the creation of fake user accounts, as well as identifying fraudulent social media posts and suspicious transactions. As a result, DataVisor's target customers are organizations in the Financial Services and/or E-commerce industry that require robust Fraud Detection software. Some of their noteworthy customers are Western Union, Affirm, Booking.com, Bill.com, and Air Asia.

## Domain Trends

### Trends and Landmarks

Over the past 10 years, things have changed dramatically in the E-commerce, financial services, and fraud detection industries. 

In E-commerce, global sales have grown from **$572B to $4.2T** between the years of 2010 and 2020 as improvements in technology, user experience, and security have been refined and adopted.

In Financial Services, as of 2020, approximately **60%** of Americans use some form of online banking which is up from **36%** in 2010. We've also seen an increase in federal regulations to help protect users information and assets during that same time period.

As a result of an ever-evolving market, the Fraud Detection industry has undergone some changes. In 2015, there were **785** major data breaches as compared to **3,205** in 2023. To keep up with the increased demand, companies like DataVisor have implemented alogorithms and deep-learning models, that are capable of discovering issues without hard coding.

### Main Competitors
Given the increase in digital fraud it is not surprising that DataVisor has a lot of competitors that are solving similar problems for their customers. Sift, ClearSale, SEON. Fraud Fighters, Riskified, and Signifyd are among some of the top competitors in the fraud detection space. In the table below, we will compare DataVisor to Signifyd anad Riskified to hopefully highlight some opportunities for growth. Reference [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/datavisor/technology) for more thorough definitions of the metrics used below.

## Recommendations

### Business Opportunity
While the [G2 table](https://www.g2.com/compare/datavisor-vs-riskified-vs-signifyd) below is not a perfect representation of each of these companies' customer bases, it does tell an interesting story.

While Riskified, Signifyd, and DataVisor are all major players in the fraud detection software industry,  DataVisor has narrowed it's scope to focus on one or two industries while  it's competitors have broadened their scope to provide services for a broader set of industries. I believe that DataVisor could improve their market share by making their product more usable and engaging for business across multiple industries.

![G2 Competitor Overview](https://github.com/davidmoyes22/ai-case-study/assets/153705227/cf25c005-c7a1-41af-96d7-f7a4d711388c)

### Technical Investment
There is a principle of product management that is refered to as **buy, build, or partner**. The basic concept is that if your company wants to expand their market they can acquire an existing company, build something from sratch, or partner with someone with the technology or domain expertise you need.

Buying can be a good option in terms of time to value, but is often one of the most expensive. Building takes time and ties up resources, but can be a good option if what you are looking for doesn't exist. Partnering introduces risk of damaging your companies reputation if your partners don't hold your same standards, but can quickly open up new revenue streams.

*My recommendation is for DataVisor to focus on partnerships to help them identify new industries where they could generate new revenue streams.* From a technical perspective, the investments that they will need to make are fairly minimal. Outside of publishing some of their APIs, the only thing DataVisor should need to do is provide partner access to sandbox accounts and product training.


### Ecosystem Investment
According to [Impact.com](https://impact.com/partnerships/how-partnerships-fuel-revenue-growth-during-economic-uncertainty/), companies that invested in partnerships saw:

1. "29 percent revenue growth per year over the last two years.
2. 41 percent growth in 2021 for brands that invested in partnerships early in the pandemic"

My recommendation for DataVisor is to invest heavily in building a robust partner network filled with technology and domain experts. Doing so will give them the tools and credibility that they need to break into new markets and start to take market share from their competitors in different industries. This course of action would be be faster than building out new product offerings to compete in new industries and significantly cheaper than acquiring another company. **At worst, investing in a partner network gives DataVisor the opportunity to validate their product-market fit in new industries at a much lower cost and at best, it will allow them to compete in new industries and open up significant future revenue streams.**
